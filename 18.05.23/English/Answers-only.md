    Dear Nancy,

    Thank you for your beautiful Christmas card. I really appreciated it. I celebrated the New Year with my family at home. We got together in a small group and enjoyed a delicious dinner together. The weather was quite chilly, but we still managed to light some fireworks and have a good time. As for my secret wish for next year, I hope to travel more.

    I'm glad to hear that you've redecorated your room and it looks much nicer now. I'm curious to know more about it. What colours did you use? Have you added any new furniture or decorations? How long did it take you to complete the project?

    I look forward to hearing from you.

    Best regards, Alexander

    The statement "It is wrong to be strict with young children" is a topic that has been debated for a long time. Some people believe that being strict with children can have a negative impact on their development, while others argue that boundaries should be set and discipline should be disciplined. In this essay, I will express my opinion on this statement and give arguments to support it.

    In my opinion, it is necessary to be strict with young children. Firstly, children should be taught discipline and boundaries from an early age. If they are not taught these values, they may grow up undisciplined and find it difficult to follow rules. Secondly, strictness can help children develop a sense of responsibility. When they are held accountable for their actions, they learn to take responsibility for their behaviour. Finally, rigour can help children develop a strong work ethic. When they are taught to work hard and be disciplined, they have a better chance of succeeding in life.

    Some people argue that being strict with young children can have a negative impact on their development. They believe that children should be allowed to explore and learn on their own without being restricted by rules and boundaries.

    While it is important to allow children to explore and learn on their own, it is equally important to set boundaries and discipline them. Children need to understand that their actions have consequences and that they are responsible for their behaviour. Without discipline, children may grow up irresponsible and struggle to follow rules. Also, strictness does not mean that children cannot explore and learn on their own. It simply means that they have to do so within the boundaries set for them.

    In conclusion, I believe that it is necessary to be strict with young children. Children need to learn discipline, responsibility and work ethic from an early age. While some may argue that strictness can have a negative impact on their development, I believe it is important to set boundaries and discipline them in a way that allows them to explore and learn on their own.
