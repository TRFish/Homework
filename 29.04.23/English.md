## Task 3: Read the text. Give a short answer

Hello! I am Harry. Last month I went to America to visit my friend Joe and his family! It was a nightmare! Everything went wrong and I do not know why!

So I wanted to make a surprise. On Saturday morning I rang the doorbell. Joe was shocked. He said he had plans for that day. I was really sad, but went to the hotel and waited till the evening. At 10.30 pm I thought it was the time, when my friend was free at last and could talk to me at least on the phone. But again he was not happy to hear me, as he was going to bed! Just imagine -- I came from Russia to visit him, and he wanted to sleep! I was broken.

We decided to meet on Sunday at 2 pm. Unfortunately, after such a long flight I overslept and was late for half an hour. When I came to the restaurant, I was as hungry as a wolf. So I began eating as soon as the waiter had brought my pasta. Meantime, Joe was still waiting for his roast beef. To be honest, I did not feel, he was glad to see me.

After the lunch I forgot to tip the waiter. That was the time, when my friend told me, I was gross and disrespectful. He explained nothing and just went home.

What shall I do now?
